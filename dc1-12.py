# Given two non-empty arrays of integers(numbers), write a function that 
# determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
# A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that arenâ€™t necessarily 
# adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in 
# the array. For instance, the numbers [1,3,4] form a subsequence of the 
# array [1,2,3,4], and so do the numbers [2,4]. Note that a single number 
# in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequences of the array.
# ( [1],[2],[3],[4]and [1,2,3,4] are all valid subsequences of [1,2,3,4] )
# Sample Output

# My Solution
array = [5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
subsequence = [1,6,-1,10]
